This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) script. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code ;)  

You can go executing different code chunks individually by clicking the *Run* button at the top of the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. You can also just run a single line if you highlight it and then press *Cmd+Enter*.

If you don't feel so comfortable working with RMarkdown, check out the available .R script in our workshop files - that you can just work with normally.

## Nice to meet you, ggplot2 

So we are officially taking our first steps with [Hardley Wickhams package ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org). 
Check out this website for more detailed information. 

What are we aiming for here?
In the next 10 to 15 minutes we will understand the underlying grammar of ggplot2, and explore how to code and modify five basic plot types this package has to offer. 

Make sure to check out the official, updated info for the [ggplot2 package]  
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf)

*Warm-up questions*
What can one do with ggplot and why use it?
* ready-to-publish plots
* plot design at a high level of abstraction
* very flexible
* systematic structuring for polishing plot appearance
* mature and complete graphics system
* many users, active mailing list

What can't I do with ggplot2?
* 3-dimensional graphics (see the rgl package)
* Graph-theory type graphs (nodes/edges layout; see the igraph package)
* Interactive graphics (see the ggvis package)

## Dataset: AirBnB in Berlin! 

To do something slightly different from the classic iris and diamonds, today we'll be packing our bags and off to Berlin we go! 

Or at least we'll do so mentally, since we'll be taking a look at data from AirBnB in this German city (sorry, there was no data available for our beloved Munich #muchdisappointment).

Anyway, [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com) is a project that uses publicly available information from the Airbnb web-site. It includes the availability calendar for 365 days in the future, and the reviews for each listing. Since every detail is taken from what is out there, there is no "private" information being used without people's consents - all of the host and place information is already available online.  

A lot of work has been put into verifying, cleaning, aggregating and analyzing the data by [an entire team](http://insideairbnb.com/behind.html), aand it's been made available below under a [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) "Public Domain Dedication"](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license - so in case you're interested, you can also download and play around with tons and tons of data from [several other cities](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

Btw, the platform offers an online [visualization tool](http://insideairbnb.com/berlin/). Our ggplots will be cool enough, but it could be worth taking a look at this tool.

Now, let's get to work. We need to download the data and read it in R; this first chunk will make our lifes easier when importing it directly from GitHub:
```{r}
#install.packages("RCurl")
library(RCurl)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

Note: There are two datasets online:

* The [raw data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pamelamatias/RLadies_MUC/master/20170521_2nd_meetup_ggplot2intro/workshop_files/Berlin_listings_raw.csv), as directly downloaded from Inside Airbnb:

* Our [workshop data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pamelamatias/RLadies_MUC/master/20170521_2nd_meetup_ggplot2intro/workshop_files/Berlin_listings_workshop.csv), which has some minor corrections for funny characters appearing in German names (such as the emoji looking o's and u's _mit umlaut_)

head(berlin)
```
As you can see, `berlin` has >20k listings for AirBnB places in Berlin, and 15 observations per listing. This dataset is actually a snapshot of the listings available at a particular time (in this case, up to last month). Let's take a quick look at the variables:
```{r exploring_berlin_01}
#Define type of variable
berlin$id <- as.integer(berlin$id)
berlin$host_id <- as.integer(berlin$host_id)
berlin$host_name <- as.factor(berlin$host_name)
berlin$neighbourhood_group <- as.factor(berlin$neighbourhood_group)
berlin$neighbourhood <- as.factor(berlin$neighbourhood)
berlin$room_type <- as.factor(berlin$room_type)
berlin$number_of_reviews <- as.numeric(berlin$number_of_reviews)
berlin$last_review <- as.Date(berlin$last_review)
berlin$calculated_host_listings_count <- as.numeric(berlin$calculated_host_listings_count)
berlin$availability_365 <- as.numeric(berlin$availability_365)
berlin$minimum_nights <- as.numeric(berlin$minimum_nights)
berlin$reviews_per_month <- as.numeric(berlin$reviews_per_month)
berlin$price <- as.numeric(berlin$price)
berlin <- berlin[,-1]
#And check out its structure
dim(berlin) #20576 x 16
str(berlin)

#summary() of each variable: five-point statistics for numeric variables, while number of entries per levels in factors

summary(berlin)

```

## BaseGraphics vs ggplot2

Compared to base graphics, ggplot2:
* can be more verbose for simple plots
* is definitely less verbose for complex and custom graphics
* requires data to be in a data.frame
* uses a different system for adding plot elements as layers

Let's take another look at the example we had before for the BaseGraphics:
```{r}
hist(berlin$availability_365)
```

and same example with ggplot2:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(berlin, aes(x = availability_365)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


But what if we want to do something slightly more complex? 

That's where the magic of __ggplot2__ comes in handy ;)


***  
## Aesthetic mapping and geometric objects

Aesthetics mapping stands for the parameters that we can actually see in our plots.
* position (i.e., on the x and y axes)
* color ("outside" color)
* fill ("inside" color)
* shape (of points)
* linetype
* size
These parameters are set with the `aes()` function. Of note, each type of geom accepts only a specific subset of all aesthetics. Check out the the geom help pages to see what mappings each geom accepts. 

Geometric objects are the actual marks that we put on a plot, such as points, lines or boxplots. They are encoded in this package as:
* points: `geom_point()`, useful for scatter plots and dot plots.
* lines: `geom_line()`, for line plots as time series and trend lines.
* bar charts and histograms: `geom_bar()`, `geom_histogram()`
* boxplots: `geom_boxplot()` or `stat_boxplot()`
* multiple facets of variables: using `facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()`

And these geom_xy() are usually added as a second step to the definition of our data space.


From here, all we need to get started is defining our dataset and the variables we wish to see plotted on the x- and y-axis, and gradually build on this. 


## Basic plots

### 1 - Scatter plot
_Scatter plots are useful when comparing two continous variables_

#### Minimum length of stay vs price
Let's explore the relationship between the minimum stay nights and the price per night.

```{r scatter_01}
#definition of the data set and variables for each axis.
ggplot(berlin, aes(x = minimum_nights, y = price))
```

Wait a second, no plot was created. Why?

Remember, we need to define how will ggplot2 actually plot our information and with which type of geometric object __geom_xy()__.

The __geom_point()__ creates a dot for each data point corresponding to the data.

```{r scatter_02}
#adding geom_point()
ggplot(berlin, aes(x = minimum_nights, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```

#### Minimum length of stay vs price
What if we add another variable that could be potentially related to the price? The physical location of a BnB home could affect the pricing, but how could our plot look if we actually identified _neighbourhood_ group? 

In order to color code for each dot in our plot according to the neighbourhood it corresponds to, we have to define an aesthetics for each data point in the __geom_point()__ as shown below in the code.

```{r scatter_03}
#Identify the neighbourhood group to which each dot belongs by color coding for it
ggplot(berlin, aes(x = minimum_nights, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = neighbourhood_group))
```

Unless it's a typo in our data, I think I _don't really_ want to stay in that home in Charlottenburg-Wilm: for more than 7500EUR a night, with a minimum stay of around 100 days? No thanks. 

***


### 2 - Line plot
_Line plots_ are useful for the visualizing a discrete (x-axis) and a continous (y-axis) variable.

#### Minimum stay vs price
With this chunk we're doing a similar plot to the one we had before, but this time as a line plot, and playing with the transparency within the __geom_line()__ parameter.
```{r line_01}
#line plots and alpha (transparency)
ggplot(berlin, aes(x=minimum_nights, y=price, color=neighbourhood_group)) +
    geom_line(alpha=0.6)
```


### 3 - Histograms and bar charts
What about 1D visualization of either categorical or continuous data? 

__geom_bar()__ and __geom_histogram()__ do the job for cases in which a categorical variable is defined for the x axis, while a continuous one is done so for the y axis.

Is is only necessary to specify the variable x when coding for our plot, since this is a simple  visualization of a single variable.

#### Bar chart

Here a nice example for the number of listings (or homes) per type of room offered.

RLadies Berlin Hint: For the illustration of exact values in a bar plot use _stat = 'identity'_ and add a definition of the y-value in the aesthetics _aes()_.

```{r bar_01}
#a simple bar chart showing the distribution of the variable room type
ggplot(berlin, aes(room_type)) + 
	geom_bar()
```

This is a bar chart showing the distribution of type of room splitted by neighbourhood. The parameter _fill_ can be added either in the plot description or as aesthetics in the geom.

```{r bar_02}
#distinguishing categories in bar charts
ggplot(berlin, aes(room_type, fill=neighbourhood_group)) + 
	geom_bar()
```

Moving bars of one catogery next to each other by adding _position_ parameter. Dodge means: Adjust position by dodging / moving overlaps to the side.

```{r bar_03}
#dodging bar charts next to each other
ggplot(berlin, aes(room_type, fill=neighbourhood_group)) + 
	geom_bar(position="dodge")
```

#### Histogram

Another good tip from RLadies Berlin: 
Even though the default is to use bins that cover the range of the data, it is better to explore multiple widths to find the one that best suits your data.

Important parameters to keep in mind: binwidth, bin

```{r histogram_01}
#simple histogram showing the distribution of pricings for overnight stays in Berlin
ggplot(berlin, aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Even ggplot2 is suggesting us to change this parameter, as to better display the data. 

Let's do so, but let's focus on those homes whose price per night is < 100 EUR (just so the distribution looks nicer for visualization purposes).
```{r histogram_01b}
berlin_price <- subset(berlin,price<100)
ggplot(berlin_price, aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r hisogram_02}
#definition of number of bins
ggplot(berlin_price, aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

```{r histogram_03}
#definition of binwidth
ggplot(berlin_price, aes(price, fill = room_type)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

```


### 4 - Boxplot

Boxplots help display the distribution of variables across different groups, for example. The first and third quantiles values correspond to the actual limits of the box, while the median is depicted as the line inside the box.

This plot shows how many reviews per month each type of room gets. 
```{r boxplot_01}
ggplot(berlin, aes(x=room_type, y=reviews_per_month)) + 
	geom_boxplot()
```

In order to add a whisker, we need to use the integrated statistics __stat_xy__ of __ggplot2__. Statistics calculate and return values based on the graph definition and are directly applied.

```{r boxplot_02}
#stat_boxplot for defining whisker
ggplot(berlin, aes(x = room_type, y = reviews_per_month))  + 
 stat_boxplot(geom ='errorbar', width = 0.65) + 
 geom_boxplot() 				# or: stat_boxplot(geom='boxplot')

```

Also boxplots are distinguishable by another catogery using the _fill_ in aesthetics _aes()_.

```{r boxplot_03}
#boxplot grouping prices per color for each cut level, transformation y-axis into log-scale
ggplot(berlin, aes(x = room_type, y = reviews_per_month, fill = neighbourhood_group)) + 
	geom_boxplot() 
```

### 5 - Multiple facets

Finally, there are times when you need to split messy graphs by one or two factors in order to make better sense of them. This can be achieved in two different manners with __ggplot2__ 

The first, __facet_wrap()__, arranges the separate facets subsequently next to each other. The number of rows and columns can be defined as additional parameter.


```{r multiple_01}
#splitted by color and arranged in the two rows
ggplot(berlin, aes(x = reviews_per_month, y = price)) +
geom_line(aes(color = neighbourhood_group)) +
facet_wrap(~neighbourhood_group, nrow = 2)

ggplot(berlin, aes(x = availability_365)) +
geom_histogram(aes(color = neighbourhood_group),bins=50) +
facet_wrap(~neighbourhood_group, nrow = 4)

ggplot(berlin, aes(x = availability_365, y = number_of_reviews)) +
geom_point(aes(color = neighbourhood_group)) +
facet_wrap(~neighbourhood_group, nrow = 4)
```

__facet_grid()__ creates a matrix-based arrangement of our plots. Dataset factors are separated by the symbol "~". If there is only a single paramter applied as x coordinate, the second one has to be coded with a placeholder ".", e.g., + facet_grid(color ~ .).

```{r multiple_02}
ggplot(berlin, aes(availability_365, reviews_per_month, color = room_type)) +
	geom_point() +
	facet_grid(.~room_type)+                     	#splitted into grid / matrix (x ~ y)
	theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 6),       #modifying grid parameter: smaller text sizees
			strip.text = element_text(size = 8)) +
	scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, 'Spectral'))+		#changing colors using RColorBrewer
	ggtitle('A beautiful ggplot2')	#plot title

ggplot(berlin, aes(calculated_host_listings_count, reviews_per_month, color = room_type)) +
	geom_line() +
	facet_grid(.~room_type)+                     	#splitted into grid / matrix (x ~ y)
	theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 6),       #modifying grid parameter: smaller text sizees
			strip.text = element_text(size = 8)) +
	scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, 'Spectral'))+		#changing colors using RColorBrewer
	ggtitle('A beautiful ggplot2')	#plot title
```

### Useful commands
Here are more common commands and parameters of __ggplot2__. 
```{r commands_ggplot2}
# coord_flip()   											- rotates your plot
# theme_bw()													- a black and white scheme
# aes(shape = , color = )							- define a variable to this parameter inside aes() and modify the shape of points or the color
# aes(fill = )												- use to distinguish a variable in a bar plot, histogram or boxplot
# scale_fill/color_manual()						- define your own colors

```
